# Downpour: Fighting Time
> Also known as "Woolie's Paradise" by nobody

Downpour is a difficulty mod that reworks the current leveling system to encourage rushing and going fast, as the game was intended. The goal of the mod is to make the early-game easier while farming gold for items and staying ahead of the curve a choice players have to make constantly.

Also changes simulacrum to be much faster paced. Aim for wave 50!

## Recommended mods to play with
- [Risk of Options](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options/): Adds in-game tweaking of all scaling values the mod provides.
- [Inferno](https://thunderstore.io/package/HIFU/Inferno/): Adds a special "Inferno Downpour" difficulty that is a fusion between Downpour and Inferno.
- [FasterBossWait](https://thunderstore.io/package/ChrisStevensonGit/FasterBossWait/): Reduces holdout time without removing it outright. Mod is balanced around having this.

## Compatibility Stuff
- [Raise Monster Level Cap](https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/Raise_Monster_Level_Cap/): Downpour already uncaps level. Having this mod will only apply to stuff you've disabled in Downpour's config.
- ANY mod that hooks `IL.RoR2.Run.RecalculateDifficultyCoefficentInternal` or `IL.RoR2.InfiniteTowerRun.RecalculateDifficultyCoefficentInternal`. This mod completely replaces how coeffs are calculated. `On` hooks are fine. **Please let me know through [issues](https://github.com/prodzpod/Downpour/issues) or discord(@prod#0339)** if you encounter such incompatibility. List of mods made compatible below.
  - [LittleGameplayTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/LittleGameplayTweaks/): Made compatiple on release (simulacrum)
